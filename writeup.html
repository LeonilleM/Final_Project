                    For my final project, I plan to create a portfolio that includes projects I've done within the
                    class, as well as my own personal projects. The portfolio will consist of two pages, a landing page
                    and an about page; both designed to be minimalistic and modern with a focus on creating a visually
                    appealing and user-friendly experience. To achieve this, I will use a basic color palette of soft,
                    neutral colors, which will add a calming and welcoming tone to the website. To enhance the overall
                    design of the website, I will be using Bootstrap and custom CSS styling. I believe that the use of
                    these two design tools will allow me to create a more cohesive and polished look for the pages, and
                    will help me to achieve a consistent design aesthetic throughout the website. I will also implement
                    Javascript and jQuery for animations within my website to make it more interactive. These will
                    include animations when scrolling, such that items will fade in and out. Lastly, before creating the
                    pages, I will use Figma to create a consistent layout for a cohesive look and feel throughout the
                    website. Link <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/GufTylLcMEgiCoezfgmPDc/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1&t=8PwVrzjEdkjzCvic-1" target="_blank">Here</a>

                <p class="write-up-body">
                    Starting with the "index" page, I plan to have an image at the top-section that will be a mix of
                    soft, neutral colors. The image will be the basis for the color palette I will be using throughout
                    all my webpages. This will include a quick introduction with my name, with animations of typing. As
                    the user scrolls down, they'll be greeted with all the projects I've done, including projects I've
                    done in the class and outside of the class. I'll only be highlighting the midterm as well as
                    providing a link to all the labs we've done for the class. And for my personal project, I plan to
                    link my weather application as well as the project my group is creating in CSS360, which is a habit
                    tracker. On the "about'' page, I plan to provide a brief statement about myself, my major, and my
                    hobbies. I believe that this information will give users a better understanding of who I am and what
                    I enjoy doing. In addition to the text, I will also include a gallery of pictures of my personal
                    projects and activities with my friends. To display the images in an engaging and interactive
                    manner, I plan to use carousels or a big diagram of multiple images, which will provide a unique and
                    dynamic user experience. Lastly, both web pages will contain a header and footer that will remain
                    consistent within both pages.

                    Throughout the project, I aim to challenge myself by trying new techniques and tools. By building on
                    my previous experiences as a web developer, I hope to create a website that is both visually
                    appealing and functionally robust. My ultimate goal is to showcase my skills and creativity as a web
                    developer and to create a website that is accessible and user-friendly. To track my progress, I plan
                    to create a new repository in GitHub called Final_project that includes all the necessary files for
                    the website, including index.html, about.html, and an assets folder containing Javascript, CSS
                    files, and photos.
